#Title: Shifting Culture from "Us and Them" to "How can we help?"

## Summary: "Us and Them" culture is deeply engrained in our organisations and can easily derail our efforts to become Agile by hindering cross functional collaboration. If we are to deliver software effectively we must find ways that change the mindset from one of blame to one where fellowship is the norm. This practical workshop explores ways to initiate this mindset shift. We'll learn how to lay the foundations by building mutual respect with listening and empathy and progress to understanding each others needs and collaborating with ease.

###Description: We'll be discussing what constitutes an "Us and Them" culture. How blaming others leaves us powerless to fix our problems and leads to  frustration, defensiveness and dispair. We'll talk about how inovation requires collaboration and how we can start collaborating with people we traditionally refer to as "Them". We'll identify simple steps that build respect through listening and empathy. We'll ask the  following questions:
 * How can we repair broken relationships?  
 * We need to identify other peoples needs and impediments but how can we do this if everyone likes to radiate an aura of infallibility? 
 * Changing the way people relate to each other will be met with persistant defensiveness; how can we  find the courage and persistance to make a change?

###Mechanics:
Here's the plan:
* 15 mins Introduction: Presentation on the principles and steps to developing a more collaborative culture
* Split in to teams of 5-7
####Part 1 Recognising "Us and Them"
* 10 minutes team discussion: Identifying who are "Us" and "Them" in our organisations. List what problems get attributed to each group by other groups. Using flip chart paper and sharpies supplied create a poster illustrating the groups and relationships you identified.
*  10 minutes group discussion: Each Team shares with the rest of the group the results
#### Part 2 "How can we help?"
* 5 minutes team discussion: Each team divides into 2 and selects an "Us" and a "Them" that they feel would benefit from closer collaboration. One half become "Us" and the other become "Them". We are now in Role play mode.
* 5 minutes role play in teams: BLAME, "Us" describes how they feel about "Them" and vice versa, blaming is encouraged!
* 10 minutes role play in teams: ACTIVE LISTENING and EMPATHY: "Us" and "Them" tell each other the problems they have working and question each other to try and discover the roots of their problems. What are each others needs?
* 10 minutes goup discussion: What did we discover? What type of questions worked well? What is the next step?
* 10 minutes role play in teams: Discuss how you can help each other work more effectively? What ways can we ensure that we continue to help each other as needs change and evolve. Create a poster illustrating your ideas.
* 10 minutes group discussion: What ways did we decide to collaborate? What ways can we understand each others needs as they change? What stands in our way to fixing these relationships in our organisations? How can we overcome those barriers?
*  5 minutes close: What can you take away from this? Is this a workshop you could run in your own organisations with real us and thems? How could we improve it?

###Learning objectives:
Aim: to develop the skills that help us work effectively in cross-functional teams
1. Should be able to identify the "Us and them" relationships in our organisations.
2.  Should understand the damage of blaming others when trying to fix problems.
3. Should understand the power of listening and empathy without judgement in healing relationships.
4. Should understand the importance of understanding other peoples needs not just what they can do for you.
5. Should discover ways to continually build relationships as needs change and evolve.

###Logistics: 
A projector for introductory presentation.
A couple of tables per team 5-7 people that they can create posters on. Each team will need a pack of sharpies and few sheets of flip shart paper.
