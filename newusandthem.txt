Us and them is a mindset
[Start with no slides, sat on a table, people around in a circle]

My Assumption is that: At some point all attempts to become Agile will fail because of an inability to collaborate with the right people. We are going to explore how we can overcome this hurdle

Tell me about your x-functional teams? 

What needs do we have that aren't on your team? Or who outside the team affects our ability to be effective. IT, devops?, Customer, Sales, Technical consultants, process consultants. Are they Silos!

What kind of relationship do you have with those people. Is it Us and Them, is it Silo'd

How much more effective could you be if those relationshipts were closer? More Collaborative, learning faster, discovering more effective ways of working together

What harm does it do 
	show new rings
Separation with Closeness
Concealment with Openness
Ignoring with Listening
Suspicion with Trust (e)
Blame with Group Reflection
Scare stories with Success stories
Punishment with Appreciation
Defensiveness with Vulnerability
Fear with Courage (e)
Frustration with Fellowship (e)


What can do to reverse this cycle?
Offer help
Listen to their difficulties
Invite collaboration
persistance
